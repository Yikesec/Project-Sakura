# DankMemerCoinFarmer - WARNING: HAS BEEN CUSTOMIZED SEVERELY FOR MY USE
I developed this to farm coins for me using the Dank Memer Discord Bot currency feature. This is extremely efficient and farmed me around 1.1million coins in 12 hours

Installation - `pip install discord.py`

1. Enter the directory your files are in on TWO TERMINALS/CMD PROMPTS
2. Edit the channel ID's to the channel ID of the channel you want the messages to be sent to. (I advise using your own server or a private one)
3. Edit your account token into the place where asked to
4. On the first terminal, run `python dankmemerreact.py` and on the second terminal, run `python dankmemersend.py`
5. You should see something that says "Logged in as `Your Discord User#XXXX`"
6. Check the channel which you chose to see if everything is working properly
7. PROFIT

Best Features: No need to have discord open and You can use discord on the same account while this is running!

**CAN BE HOSTED ON A SERVER FOR 24/7 SUPPORT**
